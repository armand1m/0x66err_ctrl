sentence=Lossless event based rotary encoder & button library
paragraph=A comprehensive library that makes working with rotary encoders (with or without a button) and individual buttons very efficient. Read the position & encoder increment for pressed and non-pressed actions. Rate limit the encoder events without losing steps (eg easy acceleration or reduce events sent over Serial). Multi-click events (1-n). Long press repeat. Many other events can be handled.
